      <p>Hi there internet, my name's Mario, and I'm a student studying web development through the University of California, Davis. I have just begun my web development journey and this page will be updated throughout my program and on.</p>

      <p>I currently hold a full-time job with the State of California. While the benefits are nice, I am looking to start some web development projects on the side in anticipation for a future career change. This will be a challenge I'm sure, but I am looking forward to it!</p>

      <p>In my free time, I enjoy watching films. Some of my favorites are Lost in Translation, Drive, and the Lord of the Rings trilogy (sorry, Hobbit....you kinda sucked). I also have a BA in film through Sacramento State University. I also love listening to music and playing videogames (PS4!). Mass Effect is my favorite game series. I like to always try new foods, as well as seeing as many new places as I can. The last place I visited was Washington, DC. I love history and it was awesome to see all the museums and monuments there! Currently deciding where to go next...any ideas?.</p>
